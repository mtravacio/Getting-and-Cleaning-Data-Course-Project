# Getting-and-cleaning-data-Course-project

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example: http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/. 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data used in this project represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

Project steps:

1- Data from training and test sets were merged to create one data set.

2- Measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted

3- Activities and variables were appropriately named.

4- A final dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was created.
